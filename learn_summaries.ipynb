    "Physical therapy is a bit slower than medications, but the point is to build up the core muscles in your back and your abdomen.\n",
    "Physical therapy is also less invasive than medications.\n",
    "So that's why we had you doing the therapy.\n",
    "But you mentioned that cost was getting to be a real issue for you.\n",
    "Can you tell me more about that?\n",
    "Well, the insurance I had only covered a certain number of sessions, and then they moved my therapy office because they were trying to work out my schedule of work.\n",
    "But that was really far away, and then I had to deal with parking, and it just started to get really expensive.\n",

    "Our goal is to get your back pain under better control without creating additional problems for you like cost.\n",
    "Let's talk about some different options and the pros and cons of each.\n",
    "So the physical therapy is actually really good for your back pain, but there are other things we can be doing to help.\n",
    "Yes, I definitely don't need to lose any more time at work and just lie around the house all day.\n",
    "Okay, well there are some alternative therapies like yoga or tai chi classes or meditation therapies that might be able to help, generic medication.\n",
    "And then there are also resources for people to look up the cheapest cost of their medications.\n",
    "But for now, I'd like to stick with the non-prescription medications.\n",
    "And if we can have you go to yoga or Tai Chi classes, like I mentioned, that could alleviate the need for ordering prescriptions.\n",
    "Yeah, that sounds good.\n",
    "Okay, great, great.\n",
    "Are there any other costs that are a problem for you in your care?\n",
